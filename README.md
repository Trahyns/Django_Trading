# Django_Trading
Stock Paper Trading website using Django and Bootstrap. The app allows users to create a portfolio of stocks in real time. The starting balance per new user created is $1 million dollars.

# Overview
Progam languages used: Django, python (for backend framework). Used Bootstrap for front end framework. To get live stock data I used Finnhub (for API), yfinance, and Plotly/Pandas.

# How to Use
Once you've made an account by hitting signup on the home page, using Django Trading is simple! Use the portfolio tab to monitor the stocks you've bought and sell any. Use the search tab to find stocks, stock info, and to buy stocks. Click the leaderboard tab to monitor other users, and that's about it.
